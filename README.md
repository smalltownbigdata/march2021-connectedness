# Small Town Big Data: March 2021
## How we stay connected: Facebook's Social Connectedness Index

This repository contains the tutorial that accompanies [this blog post](https://www.smalltownbigdata.com/post/steamboat-springs-social-connectedness-facebook). 

This month, we're offering a quick intro to the package mapdeck.. You can work in any code editor or IDE, but if you're a beginner, I recommend downloading [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/). You'll need a Mapbox access token, which is available when you make [free account on Mapbox](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/getting-started/). 

Code and instructions are available in the March2021-connectedness.html file or at [this link](https://smalltownbigdata.github.io/march2021-connectedness/march2021-connectedness.html).
